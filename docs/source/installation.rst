Installation
============

Pyrrowhead is written in Python and is installed with pip.
Pyrrowhead is written for use on Linux machines, which is reflected in these instructions.
There are no plans for Windows support, but any contributions that would add Windows support are welcome!

If you run virtual environments but want Pyrrowhead to always be available, run (**recommended**)

.. code-block:: bash

   /usr/bin/python -m pip install pyrrowhead

You can also run

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install pyrrowhead

but if you are using virtual environments Pyrrowhead will only be install in that virtual environment.

If you are in a virtual environment and only want Pyrrowhead installed there, you can also run

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyrrowhead
