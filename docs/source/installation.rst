Installing Pyrrowhead
=====================

Pyrrowhead is written in Python and is installed with pip.
Pyrrowhead is written for use on Linux machines, which is reflected in these instructions.
There are no plans for Windows support, but any contributions that would add Windows support are welcome!

If you run virtual environments but want Pyrrowhead installed globally run (**recommended**)

.. code-block:: bash

   /usr/bin/python -m pip install pyrrowhead

If you only want to install Pyrrowhead for your own user, run

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install pyrrowhead

If you do not run Python in a virtual environment and want to install it globally,
or if you want to install it in a virtual environment, run

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyrrowhead
